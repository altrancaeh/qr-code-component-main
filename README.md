## My process

Started with analyzing how many layers I'd need in order to properly fit the content, images and texts. Then i proceeded to creating the sections, divs and providing all with ids in order to facilitate styling in CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned about inset in CSS.

### Continued development

I need to continue focus on learning CSS regarding positions, mobile-first coding and best practices of clean code. In HTML, my main focus is going to be how to create the best semantic.

### Useful resources

- [Inset shorthand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset) - This helped me solve an issue with Footer position.
